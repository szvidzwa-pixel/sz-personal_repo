## Goals

Goals that I have this semester are:
- keeping up with my runna app
- completing my Hangul.

Two goals I have for this program are: 
- trying to stay ahead of the classes
- building a strong portfolio  

I would like to secure an internship by the end of the year.

I am interested in Data Science in the clinical research sector. 

I expect my day to day to consist of analyzing datasets, creating reports, and collaborating with data scientists.

## About me

My name is Shalom Zvidzwa, and I’m originally from Zimbabwe, but I’m currently based in Oakley, California. I have a background in clinical research, where I’ve worked extensively with data, budgets, and patient recruitment at Stanford. Right now, I’m pursuing my Master of Science in Business Analytics at the University of the Pacific, where I’m building strong technical skills in analytics, data visualization, and programming.
What excites me the most is the opportunity to combine my analytical skills with my background in healthcare to solve complex, real-world problems. I’m especially passionate about using data-driven insights to make informed decisions that improve processes and outcomes.
