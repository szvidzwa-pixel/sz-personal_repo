## Tell Me About Yourself (TMAY)

I started my career in clinical research, where I developed a strong foundation in managing complex datasets, coordinating multisite studies, and uncovering insights that supported both patient outcomes and operational efficiency. Over time, I realized I enjoyed not just the research itself, but the data strategy behind it, how raw information could be transformed into knowledge that drives decision making.

Building on that foundation, I gained experience with tools like Python, R, SQL, and SAS, and I’ve applied them to streamline processes, analyze large datasets, and create impactful reports. What I’ve enjoyed most in these roles is the problem solving aspect: identifying patterns, connecting the dots, and telling clear data stories that resonate with both technical and non technical audiences.

Now, as I pursue my MS in Business Analytics, I’m excited to expand into advanced analytics, machine learning, and predictive modeling. My goal is to apply these skills within healthcare, business, or technology areas where I can deliver insights that improve outcomes and fuel innovation.
